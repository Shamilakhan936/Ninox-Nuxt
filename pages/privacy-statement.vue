        <h2 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Legal basis for processing</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          The bases under the GDPR on which we rely for processing your personal data are: Consent, performance of contract and/or legitimate interest. Have we asked you for your consent?

        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Provision of your personal data</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          You are under no legal or contractual obligation to provide us with your personal data. However, the provision of some of your personal data is necessary in certain cases. For example, to send our newsletter or to answer a contact request.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">

We no longer process personal data collected in the context of registering and sending our newsletter if the relevant consent is revoked.

        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Rights of the data subjects</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          When your personal data is processed, you have several rights under the GDPR. We describe these below.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Right of access, rectification and erasure of data</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          You have the right to know from us whether we are processing your personal data and to access that personal data and certain information about its processing, provided that this does not infringe the rights (e.g. the right to privacy) and freedoms of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, you have the right to have personal data processed by us that is inaccurate or incomplete corrected. You also have the right to have your personal data deleted in certain circumstances. This is the case:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li class="font-light">If the personal data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they are processed;</li>
          <li class="font-light">If the personal data are processed on the basis of your consent, you revoke this consent and no other basis for the processing applies;</li>
          <li class="font-light">If you object to the processing of your personal data and there are no weightier legitimate grounds for the processing;</li>
          <li class="font-light">If the personal data have been processed unlawfully;</li>
          <li class="font-light">If the personal data must be erased due to a legal obligation of the respective controller.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          In certain circumstances, you also have the right to temporarily "stop" the processing of your personal data.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Right to data portability</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          Subject to certain conditions, you have the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You can then transfer this personal data to another party. You can also ask us to transfer your personal data directly to that other party.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          The right to portability only applies to granted data that is processed automatically on the following bases:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
          <li class="font-light">your consent (or that of your parent/legal guardian); or</li>
          <li class="font-light">the necessity of the processing for the performance of a contract to which you are a party.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Right to object</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          In certain circumstances, you may object to the (further) processing of your personal data. We will then stop processing unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for processing your personal data.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Identification on exercise</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          You can exercise the above rights by making a written request to us (including a request by email). We may ask you to identify yourself.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Right to complain to a supervisory authority</h3>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
          You have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority (in the Netherlands, the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens). This is possible, for example, if you believe that the processing of your personal data does not comply with the law or if you have any other complaint.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-normal mb-2 text-black">Contacting us</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-10 font-light">
